        <h2>The TERA Project</h2>
        <p>
            TERA is the MMORPG game in PC, living the services for a long time, about 7 years. TERA has been designed and developed for combatting specialized in the console pad. TERA has gathered their fans by a unique non-targeting combat system in MMORPG, which is one of major reason to remain the beloved MMORPG game.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a long time, fans of TERA are eager to come out in Consoles. The PC development environment for TERA is one of big barrier to hinder porting TERA to previous consoles. This generation of consoles (PS4 and Xbox One) is based on x86/x64 architecture and provides similar environment like PC. Overall console game market becoming friendly to MMORPG game and long desire from old TERA fans starts the console porting for TERA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Porting existing game to consoles with minifying changes is very hard. The project is started from upgrading the Unreal Engine 3. It means that the project is starting from scratch.  In retrospect, it was hard and painful to overcome each step. But it was the moment that I could become better engine programmer as well as console programmer
